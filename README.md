## About

I am an aspiring **_linux kernel_** developer having proficiency in low level languages such as **C**. I am passionate about the 
emerging field of Embedded systems . I possess good knowledge of C programming and Linux kernel. I like to solve problems with the help of code. I had got an opportunity from my college to do internship in the field of **VLSI** which helped to understand about the chip designing. Later I started to learn C programming and gradually explored the *_Embedded systems_* field.
